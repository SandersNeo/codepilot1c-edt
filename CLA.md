# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## CodePilot1C — Individual Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **CodePilot1C** (the "Project").
This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted
by contributors to the Project Maintainer.

By submitting a Contribution to this Project, you accept and agree to the
following terms and conditions.

---

## 1. Definitions

**"You" (or "Your")** means the individual who submits a Contribution to
the Project.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any
modifications or additions to an existing work, that is submitted by You to
the Project for inclusion in the Project. "Submitted" means any form of
communication sent to the Project (e.g., pull request, patch, issue comment,
email), excluding communications clearly marked "Not a Contribution."

**"Project Maintainer"** means the copyright holder(s) of the Project who
manage the Project and accept Contributions.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

You hereby grant to the Project Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and any derivative works.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

You hereby grant to the Project Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make,
have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Your
Contributions, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s)
alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Project.

## 4. Right to Relicense

You understand and agree that the Project Maintainer may license the Project
(including Your Contributions) under any license terms, including proprietary
licenses, without further permission from or compensation to You.

**This is the key clause that enables dual licensing: publishing the Project
as open source (AGPL-3.0) while also offering a separate commercial license.**

## 5. Representations

You represent that:

- (a) You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses.
- (b) Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see Section 7 for
  third-party works).
- (c) If You are employed, Your employer has waived any intellectual property
  rights to Your Contributions, or You have received permission to make
  Contributions on behalf of Your employer.

## 6. No Obligation

You understand that the decision to include Your Contribution in the Project
is entirely at the discretion of the Project Maintainer and that this Agreement
does not obligate the Project Maintainer to use Your Contribution.

## 7. Third-Party Works

If any part of Your Contribution includes work that is not Your original
creation, You must clearly identify it in Your Contribution, including the
original author, license, and any restrictions.

## 8. Notification

You agree to notify the Project Maintainer of any facts or circumstances of
which You become aware that would make these representations inaccurate.

## 9. No Warranty

Your Contributions are provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind. You
are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the
extent You desire to provide support.
